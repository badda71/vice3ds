Preconfigured button functions:

    Select: open Vice menu
    Start: open Gamebase64 launcher

    R-button: Autofire. Within vice menu, R-button starts the mapping of a hotkey.
    C-Stick: cursor keys
    L/ZL-buttons: left/right mouse buttons if mouse is enabled.

    Soft buttons functions (from left to right, top to bottom) :
        Autostart image
        Hit RUN/STOP
        Toggle joystick ports
        Toggle C-Pad / D-Pad for joystick
        Warp Mode

        Quickload snapshot
        Quicksave snapshot
        Toggle True Drive Emulation
        Hard Reset
        Pause emulation

        Attach disk image to drive 8
        Toggle Sprite-Sprite collisions
        Power off bottom screen backlight
        Type command: LOAD\"*\",8,1 - RUN
        Type command: LOAD\"$\",8 - LIST

        Hit RUN/STOP
        Hit SPACE
        Hit RETURN
        Enable Mouse
        Toggle No borders / Fullscreen

This (and a lot of other things) can be changed in Vice menu. To change the mapping of a soft button (or actually any other button incl. all the 3DS- and soft keyboard buttons) to a menu item in Vice menu, press the R-button when the menu item is selected, then touch/press the button. This button will now be mapped to the selected menu entry.

From v1.6 on, Vice3DS will run with acceptable framerates (~20 fps with fastSID emulation) on O3DS. However, a N3DS is recommended: Only here, you will get the full 50fps and incredible reSID sound.

## Compiling
